This talk was my Ph.D. dissertation defense titled, <i>"Search for Signatures of Large Extra Dimensions in High-Mass Diphoton Events from Proton-Proton Collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with CMS"</i>. This is based on my work as a graduate student at the University of Alabama.

<b>Abstract:</b> A search is performed for a nonresonant excess of high-mass diphoton events over the Standard Model background prediction. Such an excess could be a signature of new physics, such as from the existence of extra spatial dimensions in the universe. The sample of diphoton events were produced in proton-proton collisions using the Large Hadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{âˆ’1}$ and were recorded in 2016 with the CMS detector. Compared to Standard Model background sources, the data are consistent with the background-only hypothesis and the results are interpreted in the context of the large extra-dimensional model of Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali. This result provides the best model limits from searches in the diphoton channel and is published in Ref. [1].
