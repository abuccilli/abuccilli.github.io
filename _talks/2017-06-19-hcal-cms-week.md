This talk was presented during our summer CMS Week collaboration meeting. It is titled, <i>"HF and HEP17 Phase Settings in 2017"</i>. This is based on my work timing-in the CMS hadron calorimeter (HCAL) during the 2017 upgrade at the start of that year. The hardware was upgraded on the HCAL hadron forward (HF) subdetector and on sector 17 of the positive side of the Hadron Endcap (HE).
