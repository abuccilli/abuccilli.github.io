This is the pre-approval talk I gave on behalf of my analysis team presented to the CMS EXO Physics Analysis Group. It is titled, <i>"EXO-17-017 pre-approval: Search for a non-resonant excess in the high-mass diphoton channel at 13 TeV"</i>. As the Analysis Contact, I helped lead our analysis to a successful pre-approval after 2 years of research. This allowed our analysis to proceed into internal review, where it was scrutinized before before being approved for publication.
