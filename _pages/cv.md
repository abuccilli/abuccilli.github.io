Research Experience
======
* <b>Graduate Research,</b> University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, Summer 2013 - Fall 2018
  <br> My Ph.D. dissertation research is in experimental high energy particle physics and largely consisted of performing:

  * Big data analysis: Ph.D. research as member of 4000+ person CMS Collaboration at the CERN LHC analyzing PBs of data recorded by the CMS detector

  * Collaboration: Member of 5 statistical analysis teams searching for new physics and manager of a new 3 year long project, leading the analysis to publication

  * Data reduction: Wrote dedicated analysis packages for reducing data to GBs on remote computing clusters distributed across a worldwide HPC grid

  * Signal optimization: Improved (photon) particle identification by up to 50% in analysis region over standard procedure

  * Background rejection: Reduced fake signals to percent level by tuning custom tagging algorithms in samples produced from Monte Carlo simulation

  * Data interpretation: Applied Bayesian inference to set limits on new theory according to data

  * APS conference talk: [http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR18/Session/C09.5](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/APR18/Session/C09.5)
  * Publication: [https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.092001](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.092001)
  * Analysis code: [https://github.com/cms-exotica-diphotons/diphoton-analysis](https://github.com/cms-exotica-diphotons/diphoton-analysis)

  During this time, I was a CERN lab user, member of the CMS Collaboration, and a user of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) LHC Physics Center's computing cluster.

  I have contributed to the CMS diphoton searches organized using the CMS analysis codes EXO-17-017, EXO-16-027, EXO-16-018, EXO-15-004, and EXO-12-045, serving as the Contact Person for EXO-17-017. The results of these searches are found under my list of publications.

  I was employed as a Graduate Research Assistant from Summer 2014 - Fall 2017 and during Summer 2018, but actively involved with dissertation research since Summer 2013.

* <b>Graduate Research Assistant / On-site lab user,</b> European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN), Geneva, Switzerland, Spring 2016 - Summer 2017
  <br> While based on-site at CERN, I was primarily involved with:

  * Detector operations: Regular 24/7 on-call expert for the CMS detector responsible for promptly addressing problems with flexibility and coordinating activity during daily meetings

  * Detector performance: Utilized a data analysis to synchronize all 3500 new detector readout channels for production use in 2016 and 2017

  Our analysis code is maintained at [https://github.com/HCALPFG](https://github.com/HCALPFG). I wrote some template code to help new members of the group at [https://github.com/HCALPFG/HcalTupleAnalyzerExample](https://github.com/HCALPFG/HcalTupleAnalyzerExample).
